Captain Tarkin, the officer taking care of the event, would like to improve the expirience of the airlines guests implementing a new, fast and touchless onbording expirience.

He know that a brave company in the Galaxy built a set of APIs that can be used exactly for this.

Imperial Airlines needs to build an application ables to use this APIs and this should not be an issue except for one single thing:

**The application maust be completed in just ONE DAY**

The reward for this challenge is, anyway, as great as the challenge itself: a big box full of Baskar!
